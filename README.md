This is the code repository for [Apache Solr 5.x Beginner's Guide - Second Edition](Current URL?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785282430), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.


## About the Book
Apache Solr is a standalone enterprise search server, exposing services for advanced text search, spatial search, faceted search, and analytics. Solr’s architecture is very fast and scalable, from working prototypes to complex distributed architecture. The internal workflow is also open to components’ customization, and integration with external tools for advanced text analysis.

This book is a practical introduction to the Solr platform that shows you how to configure your own search engine experience and embed a search engine in your website to help users navigate the data.

We start with the basics of how to use Solr and perform indexing on the default installation. You’ll be introduced to the workings of the Solr schema API, the structure of an inverted index, text analysis, and the concept of similarity. Next, we demonstrate indexing and searching with some sample data.

Moving on, you’ll learn how to use a faceted search and work with multiple entities and multicores, and how to index external data sources such as open source datasets. You’ll get to grips with basic SolrCloud concepts such as routing / shard splitting, Zookeeper, and clustering Solr for distributed searches using SolrCloud. You’ll also learn how to detect language with Tika and LangDetect.

At the end of the book, we create a project on a site for bookcrossing, which puts all the concepts together to give you the bigger picture.
